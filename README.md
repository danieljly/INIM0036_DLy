# INIM0036_DLy
Code for INIM0036 Project - all data, code, etc. will be uploaded. Pickle files will be attempted to be compressed and uploaded.
-----------------------

IF YOU WANT TO VIEW ALL OF THE TABLES OF MOSTLY RAW DATA, ACCESS THE FOLDER 'DataFrames' - all of the data should be in there as CSV files, openable by programs such as Microsoft Excel.
IF YOU WANT TO VIEW PROCESSED DATA, ACCESS THE FOLDER 'Processed_Data' - all of the data should be in there as CSV files, openable by programs such as Microsoft Excel.
IF YOU WANT TO VIEW ALL OF THE GRAPHS, ACCESS THE FOLDER 'Figures_Generated' - all of the graphs generated by "plotting.py" as well as the boxplots are available in this folder, as PNG files.


-----------------------

NOTE THAT THERE ARE #TODO STATEMENTS FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO CHANGE - THIS IS ALL MAINLY FILE PATHING.

If you wish to attempt to recreate the data shown in the project, run the following in order: 
1. run 'generate_socialgraph.py'. This should create 10 text files named 'socialgraph_0' to 'socialgraph_9'
2. run 'test_run_simulations.py', but HEED THE #TODO STATEMENTS. All proportions are in decimal form, so to test a percentage superspreader compliance, you will have to divide your percentage by 100.
3. run any of the other Python files - to ensure as much accuracy as possible, all of the data was taken from the pickle files.
